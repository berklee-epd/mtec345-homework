## 1. AI Reflections
### Positive Experience
#### Think of one time you used AI that surprised, excited, or impressed you.

* What tool did you use?
* What were you trying to do?
* Why did you respond the way you did?

_Write at least one paragraph (3+ sentences)._

<br> When Suno first launched, it quickly drew widespread attention, which sparked my curiosity. I created an account to explore what this music AI was actually capable of. I challenged Suno to generate a very specific genre, and it performed surprisingly well. The groove was convincing, and the lyrics followed an appropriate rhythmic structure.

Before this, I had never used any music AI, so this first encounter was genuinely shocking. It was also a little scary. Seeing this made it clear that the barrier to creating music has dropped significantly. As a result, the industry now faces not only more accessibility, but also far more competition.

LALAL.AI is another impressive AI audio tool that I use frequently for stem-splitting. In addition, I find ChatGPT especially effective at explaining scientific and mathematical concepts, since those topics tend to have clear, well-defined answers.

### Negative Experience
#### Think of one time you used AI that frustrated, disturbed, or angered you.

* What tool did you use?
* What were you trying to do?
* Why did you respond the way you did?

_Write at least one paragraph (3+ sentences)._

I used ChatGPT to research sources for my music history essay, hoping to find more articles related to my topic. However, the information it provided was often inaccurate, and the websites it referenced were neither convincing nor academically reliable. 

At other times, I used ChatGPT for resume suggestions, but it struggled to use correct music-industry terminology. The results edits tended to be very vague and general, and appeared unprofessional.

## 2. Class Discussion
### Observations
#### Document 2-3 interesting things you learned from classmates during our discussion. What experiences or perspectives stood out to you?

<br>
### Takeaway
#### Write one sentence on how this discussion changed or reinforced your perspective on AI in music.

<br>
## 3. Looing Ahead
### Aspiration
#### What is one thing you want to accomplish with AI in music this semester? This could be a skill you want to develop, a project idea, or something you want to explore.

<br> I would love to explore how AI-generated music works and gain a deeper understanding of the concepts that underpin this technology. I want to familiarize myself with the most advanced methods currently used in the AI music field, as well as the key challenges the industry faces.

Because I am very new to this topic, even foundational information would be extremely helpful. My goal is to develop enough technical literacy to communicate meaningfully with AI and computer science researchers and professionals. More broadly, I want to learn how AI systems are trained: what kinds of data they rely on, the different training methods involved, and the range of applications AI has in music today.

<br>
### Questions
#### List 2-3 questions you have about AI and music that you hope this course addresses.

1. How are AI models trained to understand musical structure, style, and genre, and what kinds of data are required for effective music generation?
2. How capable is AI of generating large-scale, long-form music works (such as operas, symphonies, or musical theatre) eand what technical challenges limit its ability to maintain structural and narrative coherence over extended durations?
3. Who should be considered the author of AI-generated music—the model’s developers, the user who prompts it, or the artists whose works were used in training—and how should credit and compensation be handled?
