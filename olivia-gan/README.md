## MP&E


## What brings you to this class?
I found this class on the creative coding minor website. I'm really interested in learning more about AI music and the structure behind it. I think this will be very helpful information for future producers. I'm really interested in immersive audio too so I'm curious how machine learning can help build tools that give mixing suggestions and allows better translation playing on different consumer products.

## What is your experience with machine learning?
I have zero experience with machine learning before but I'm eager to learn about it. I have brought an open mind to this topic and am excited to see where I will be by the end of the semester. 


## What do you want to get out of this class?
I want to continue building my coding skills. More importantly I want to get myslef familiarized with the terminologies and technologies that are used in this field of the music industry. 

## What is one aspect of this class that you are excited and/or nervous about?
I'm excited and nervous about coding. I'm excited to explore topics that I have not heard before. Generally speaking this is a very new territory for me so I'm excited for all new information : )
