# AI Reflections

## Positive Experience
I was really impressed the first time I used Gemini. I wanted it to simplify the book I was reading so I uploaded the entire PDF onto it and had it create a side by side translation into simple English and because of that I was able to better understand the concepts and themes the author was trying to convey.
## Negative Experience
I tried having Deepseek solve some issues on my Unity project last semester and it lead me around a loophole where it never solved my problem but instead increased the complexity of it. I was trying to have it so that when the player clicked with their mouse it would trigger a sound.
## Aspiration
How can I teach AI to compose music?
How can I use AI to create code that generates music?
How do I create a workflow utilizing AI?
