## Electronic Production & Design (EPD)


## I really enjoyed the AI class I took before, which motivated me to continue exploring machine learning more seriously.



## I have learned some basic concepts of transformer models and have a general understanding of how they work, but I’m still at an early stage.


## I want to gain a deeper understanding of machine learning—especially how attention mechanisms work—and learn how to train models through hands-on practice.


## I’m excited to explore machine learning in depth, but a bit nervous about the Python coding side. That said, I’m very motivated to improve.
