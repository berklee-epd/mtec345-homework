# Lab 1: AI Reflections

## 1. AI Reflections

### Positive Experience

I remember the first time I used Suno to generate a game soundtrack that I could implement into a first-person shooter game I built in Unreal Engine. I was really surprised by how good the result was. It was also interesting that I could generate multiple variations based on the same idea. The main issue I noticed was that the mix quality lacks a bit. There were distortions and high-frequency noise in the track. However, I think it’s a great tool for inspiration.

### Negative Experience

There was a time when I felt frustrated using ChatGPT. I had just started learning Csound and wanted to understand the basics of how the software works. However, ChatGPT sometimes made simple concepts harder to understand. Many of the examples it generated were either wrong or overly complicated. I felt it’s only effective for certain tasks, and it might not be well-trained on less common tools like Csound.

## 2. Class Discussion

### Observations

We discussed how geometric patterns in harmonic structures can affect how people react to wrong notes. More even and symmetrical note patterns make changes easier to identify, while less even and irregular patterns make those changes harder to notice.

In the AI Music Contest, some of the music was very inspiring. For example, Br00KLYN did a great job capturing the characteristics of the city and translating them into music. The AI-generated EP artwork for the team was also very fitting.

### Takeaway

I think AI tools are improving extremely fast. At first, many people ignored them, but now they’re being widely used across different fields. AI can definitely help us make many tasks easier and more efficient.

## 3. Looking Ahead

### Aspiration

One thing I want to accomplish with AI in music this semester is to better understand how generative AI works. I’m interested in creating a model specifically for sound designers like myself, one that can take everyday sounds and turn them into creative soundscapes for games or films.

### Questions

- How does generative AI actually work?
- How can we build our own AI models?
