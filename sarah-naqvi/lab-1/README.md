# 1. AI Reflections
### Positive Experience
I had a really positive experience the first few times I was experimenting with what AI could do. I was in the process of searching for REUs and internships to apply to, so I decided to ask ChatGPT to find some that were related to my interests. I remember asking it to find opportunities related to music, psychology, and technology. In response to this, ChatGPT found a myriad of internships that met the critera I requested. What really surprised me the most was that it had organized all the data into an easy to read chart that showed which internships were paid, what topic they focused on, location, description, and even offered links to their original websites. It had presented the information in a neat chart format that I didn't even have to ask for! 

### Negative Experience
ChatGPT became my go-to AI tool; however, it really frustrated me when I tried to use it to help me write Csound code. I was trying to create a bit crusher effect and also have a VU meter in a plug-in that I was developing in Csound. I thought that going through the opcodes for using Csound in manual would take too much time and figured that Csound could help me be more efficient. The code ChatGPT provided for the bitcrusher failed and I realized, after comparing with the manual, that there were so many errors and inputs that didn't make sense. When I pointed out these flaws to ChatGPT and questioned the code, I found myself getting angry because ChatGPT would frame its responses in a very confident way...even though not all of its answers were correct. It felt like communicating with an arrogant person that claimed to have more knowledge than they really did. I actually ended up wasting time with ChatGPT and should have just read through the manual and opcodes for Csound. 
# 2. Class Discussion 
### Observations
Some perspectives that stood out to me during our class discussion was that AI should be seen as a tool in the music industry as opposed to something to be feared. Another interesting experience I learned about was utilizing AI in order to generate ideas and brainstorm but then taking that information and using one's own judgement to decide what to takeaway from it and what to ignore. 
### Takeaway
This discussion reinforced the idea that AI is not inherently evil nor is it perfect and foolproof when it comes to its applications in music creation. 
# 3. Looking Ahead
### Aspiration
I would like to explore using AI for a composition, much like the songs we looked at in the AI song contest. I want to have the confidence to be able to understand exactly what the AI tools are doing and what I can do to contribute my own human style whilst using these AI tools. 
### Questions 
* How can AI replicate unique timbres of instruments, especially timbres of instruments that aren't culturally western and thus have limited sample libraries available? Is this even a possibility or does there need to be large existing sample libraries?
* Are there ways we can identify if AI is used in music? In other words, is there something to look out for that maybe seems too perfect, like some of the AI generated images?
