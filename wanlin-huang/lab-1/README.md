# Lab 1 – AI Reflections

## 1. AI Reflections

### Positive Experience

I have had many positive experiences with AI, especially in my EPD classes where technical concepts can become complex very quickly. One tool I use often is **ChatGPT**, particularly when I don’t fully understand certain technical terms or systems discussed in class. I sometimes collect all of my class notes and ask ChatGPT to generate practice tests or pop quizzes, which helps me memorize project requirements and key concepts more effectively. This use of AI surprised me because it turned my confusion into an active learning process instead of passive review.

Another tool I enjoy using is **Cursor**, which helps me visualize technical ideas through code. With just a single prompt, I can create a simple synth or small demo that shows how a theory works in practice, making abstract knowledge much easier to understand. I also use **Gemini**, which helped me work with **Three.js** and **MediaPipe** to create small interactive installation experiments, even though I don’t have a strong coding background. These tools make complex systems feel more accessible and encourage me to experiment more freely.

### Negative Experience

One negative experience I have had with AI is realizing that it can make my thinking lazier if I rely on it too much. Because AI is so helpful and fast, I sometimes skip the more difficult and “painful” parts of problem-solving that are important for developing deeper understanding. Over time, this made me feel like I was exercising my brain less than before. This experience made me more aware that while AI is powerful, it needs to be used carefully so it supports learning rather than replacing it.

## 2. Class Discussion

### Observations

I really enjoyed hearing the different perspectives people brought into the class discussion. Everyone seemed to use AI in different ways, and there were also very different opinions toward its role in music and creativity. Compared to last semester’s AI class, this class feels larger, and while some topics overlap, the range of viewpoints feels broader. I especially enjoyed the conflicts between different perspectives, because they pushed the discussion deeper and made the class more engaging.

### Takeaway

The discussion made me feel excited about this class and the research opportunities it might lead to, especially exploring AI in a deeper and more critical way than last semester.

## 3. Looking Ahead

### Aspiration

Looking ahead, I want to continue experimenting with how AI can be used efficiently as a creative tool rather than just a shortcut. I am still exploring how to use AI in a way that keeps creative decision-making in my own hands. Seeing AI music composition competitions made me think about whether creativity in the future might become only prompt-based, but after reading about those projects, I realized that the most successful ones use AI thoughtfully and intentionally, not passively.
