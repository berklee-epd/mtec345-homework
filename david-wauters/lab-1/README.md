# Lab 1: AI Reflections

## 1. AI Reflections

### Positive Experience

In an earlier semester I had to learn how to use the DAW Cubase, and was having some technical troubles with it. I went to my professor's office hour to work through it, and he directed me to a version of Chat-GPT programmed specifically to help with Cubase. After that point I began using it throughout the semester whenever I was having other technical issues, and it surprised me every time with the way it intimately knew the software. It almost felt like it could see my session and tell me exactly what was wrong based on it, even though it was only working based on the prompts I gave it. I was very impressed with this version of Chat-GPT, and also surprised that such a thing even existed.

### Negative Experience

This is not a time where I was using AI but when I witnessed someone else using it. I was walking through a grocery store and overheard someone speaking into their phone, venting about personal issues. I was expecting to hear a friend or family member on the other end, but then I heard what was clearly an AI voice respond to their issues and give advice. I'm not sure which model it was, but likely Chat-GPT. I was pretty disturbed by this, and since then I've heard that this is becoming a more common thing catastrophized as "replacing therapy with AI." I can see and feel the concern behind it, but I'm also not sure it's to that point yet. To me it feels like people seek out advice from the AI in the same way they do with friends, but because LLMs are trained on such a large collection of data they're able to provide responses that sound more nuanced than something that a friend might be able to come up with.

## 2. Class Discussion

### Observations

One thing we talked about that struck me was the ethical considerations of AI in regards to cultural appropriation. Specifically in regards to training a model on data that has significance to certain cultures without giving proper acknowledgement. Additionally, there were ethical considerations towards AI not only about taking away work from real people but also taking potential innovations. When models are trained on so much data, any potential innovations that they're trained on become obfuscated and the original meaning can get lost.

### Takeaway

Problems like these have been prevalent for much longer than AI has been around, it's just something to stay aware of as it's now a new avenue for such issues to arise.

## 3. Looking Ahead

### Aspirations

This semester I simply want to understand the AI music scene today and how it is impacting the music scene as a whole, as I feel it is part of my responsibility as a musician to be informed on such topics instead of blindly listening to what others have to say about it.

### Questions

- What is the environmental impact of music models such as Suno in comparison to LLMs which are more commonly used? 
- What exactly is the "AI bubble" and how does it relate to AI and music research? Is there a more localized "AI music bubble?"
