1AI Reflections
Positive Experience

One experience that  impressed me was using Gemini to help debug a C# script in Unity. I was trying to implement a raycast system to project the mouse position onto a 3D plane, but I could not figure out why it was not working correctly. After pasting my code into Gemini, it pointed out a key step I had overlooked: I needed to store the raycast hit information  before using it to place objects on the 3D surface. What impressed me was that Gemini not only identified the missing logic in my code, but also explained how to improve the overall raycast workflow, which helped me better understand the system rather than just fixing the bug.

Negative Experience

I was using ChatGPT to help build a Blueprint system in Unreal Engine. I was trying to create a dynamic footstep system where different sound samples would play depending on the surface type the character was walking on. The process was difficult because the explanations were often incomplete and did not clearly address the core problem I was facing. Important concepts such as variable scope, public versus private variables, and required setup steps were not clearly distinguished, which caused missing information and confusion. As a result, I spent more time correcting and filling in gaps from the AI’s response than actually implementing the Blueprint system.

2. Class Discussion
Observations

During the in-class discussion, one interesting observation was that although everyone uses AI for different purposes, many of us tend to rely on it too heavily. Several classmates mentioned that AI often gives answers that sound correct, which can make users less likely to verify or critically evaluate the information. Another perspective that stood out was the idea that AI can speed up workflows, but it can also reduce deep understanding if it replaces problem-solving instead of supporting it.

Takeaway

This discussion reinforced my view that AI has already become integrated into many stages of music production and significantly accelerates creative iteration.

3. Looking Ahead
Aspiration

This semester, I want to use AI as a practical creative tool in music rather than just a conceptual one. My goal is to experiment with AI-generated or AI-assisted samples that are actually usable in my projects. I also hope that AI can introduce new sonic ideas and provide creative stimulation that expands my musical taste and sound palette.

Questions

How does RAVE work in practice, and what are its strengths and limitations in sound generation and transformation?

How do deep learning models represent or classify different musical attributes such as timbre, pitch, rhythm, and texture?

At what stages of the music production process is AI most effective in improving creative quality rather than just increasing speed?
