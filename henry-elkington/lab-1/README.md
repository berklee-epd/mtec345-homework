# Lab 1: AI Reflections

## 1. AI Reflections

### Positive Experience

When I was learning CPP, I did not know much about anything relating to the build system, but I used anthropic to teach me CMake and how to use it effectively. I would try something, and it would not work, and I would ask Claud why and to explain it to me. What surprised me is that if I asked for a different explanation, it would have a few. Another thing that surprised me is if I asked it to explain all the topics in the category around some part of the build system or something like templates, it could make a little bit of a “curriculum” for me to research on my own, and it would be able to link me to super good resources. One other thing that surprised me, is that if I gave it an implementation in Elixir, which I know very well, it could make the same implementation in CPP but idiomatic, and then it could walk through every line and explain why people in CPP do things that way. I basically used it as a search engine, and it surprised me how much better it was than google at doing that.

### Negative Experience

I understand LLMs as a statistical grouping of data, and I thought most people though the same, but I was talking to a few of my friends back home who didn't understand the technology very well, but I found out that they had been using ChatGPT for most of there work in the art program they were in. It was interesting because I saw what they were making and it, at the time, was really good. I don't remember what they were using, but I knew it was an off the shelf model they were paying for. They truly believed that they were collaborating with a conscious being, and had no understanding that it was not a person. What freaked me out was that AI was a really good tool, but I realized then that most people would treat it as a one size fits all solution for almost everything, only because it uses similar language as us.

## 2. Class Discussion

### Observations

A point that was brought up is that even though AI feels weird in a few ways, it is good to understand fully why you feel weird about it, rather than blindly hate something. I like that mentality. I also remember the topic brought up is that AI, even though it has some weird thing happing with it that I don't like at all, I love the math and stats and research behind it. Its like weapon development, even guns are used for almost entirely violence, the mechanics and engineering is so interesting to me.

### Takeaway

AI is an interesting technology I want to learn more about, because I like the math and engineering, and because I like to understand why I do and don't like a thing.

## 3. Looking Ahead

### Aspiration

I want to learn way more about the internals of the most interesting AI models, and I would love to read more and learn more about the math and nitty-gritty details of Machen learning. As a stretch goal, I would like to implement my own custom Machen learning model that's not just a demo project but actually useful. 

### Questions

- I want to get more resorces on AI and ML research and maybe where do I find this and where do I go for more self learning.
- How can I implement large scale data collection for my own models?
